üêç What is __pycache__?

__pycache__ is a special folder automatically created by Python when you run a program.
It stores the compiled bytecode files of your .py scripts.
These files usually have names like:
       module_name.cpython-310.pyc

‚ö° Why does Python create __pycache__?
1. Performance optimization 

   When you run a .py file, Python first compiles it into bytecode.
  This bytecode is stored in __pycache__ so the next time you run the program, Python can skip recompilation ‚Üí faster execution.

2.  Version-specific storage

    If you switch between Python versions, different .pyc files can exist inside the same __pycache__, avoiding conflicts.
