2.Feature analysis (identifying key variables)
3.Model training/testing (running trial machine learning or statistical models)

1.User/Entity IDs â†’ Unique identifiers for records
2.Attributes/Features â†’ Numerical, categorical, or text-based variables (e.g., age, activity, category, score)
3.Timestamps/Logs â†’ Time-based tracking of events or interactions
